The sky stole the show when I was out looking for photos a month ago.
With the clouds low over a rise and the evening sun brightly coloring them,
 my exposure threw the trees into dark silhouettes.
  That is one of my favorite landscape elements so I enjoyed composing images
  as these shapes appeared and quickly evaporated.
